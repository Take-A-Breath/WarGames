Per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDMP):
> NDMP, or Network Data Management Protocol, is a protocol meant to transport data between network attached storage (NAS) devices and backup devices. This removes the need for transporting the data through the backup server itself, thus enhancing speed and removing load from the backup server. 

```Console
bandit14@bandit:~$ telnet localhost 30000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
